# Graphs
all about directed and undirected graphs and finding minimum spanning tree
there can be small changes to prim's algorithm(i.e..modified prim) which makes prim's to run better than earlier(but not a drastic change in time complexity)
there also can be a small modification to Dijkstra's algorithm in a similar way as modification can be done to a prim's as discussed above
